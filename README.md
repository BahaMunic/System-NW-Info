# Code Purpose:
This Python code creates a graphical user interface (GUI) tool for displaying various system and network information. It allows users to easily access information such as computer name, IP address, processor details, disk drives, operating system, active processes, network status, and results from commands like ping, traceroute, nslookup, and more.
# Code Breakdown:
## 1. Import Libraries:
os: For interacting with the operating system.
subprocess: For executing system commands.
socket: For obtaining network information.
tkinter: For creating the graphical user interface.
simpledialog, ttk, messagebox, Menu: For providing additional GUI components.
## 2. Define Functions:
clear_screen: Clears the screen.
get_computer_info: Retrieves the computer name and IP address.
run_command: Executes a system command and returns the output.
Other functions: Each function executes a specific system command and displays the result in the text area.
## 3. Create the GUI:
Windows and Components: Creates the main window, menu, buttons, and text area for displaying results.
Button Events: When a button is clicked, the corresponding function is executed to perform the system command and display the result.
## 4. Execute Commands:
The run_command function is used to execute system commands like systeminfo, wmic, tasklist, ping, tracert, nslookup, and others.
The command outputs are converted to text and displayed in the text area.
## Tool Functions:
Display System Information: Computer name, IP address, processor details, disk drives, operating system, and active processes.
Test Connectivity: Ping, traceroute, nslookup, and check port status.
Manage Processes: Search for and terminate processes.
## Features:
Simple User Interface: Easy to use, even for beginners.
Comprehensive Information: Provides a wide range of system and network information.
Flexible: Can be customized and extended with new features.
Open-Source: Anyone can view, modify, and distribute the code.
## How it Works:
When the tool is run, the GUI is created.
Clicking a button triggers the associated function.
The function executes the desired system command using subprocess.run.
The command output is displayed in the text area.
## Uses:
System Management: Monitor system status and troubleshoot issues.
Educational Purposes: Learn about how the operating system and network work.
Automation: Integrate with other tools to create automation scripts.
## Notes:
System Commands: The commands used in this code are specific to Windows. You may need to modify them for other operating systems.
GUI Customization: The GUI can be further customized to add more features or change the appearance.
Security: Exercise caution when using system commands, especially those for terminating processes, as they can cause system instability if not used correctly.
